1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

> Developing a CRUD Python module is going to be something that is going to be reused as often as I need it! If I could make this module completely modular.. now that's the ticket! Let's see if that can be possible. Readable? COMMENTS! ADAPTABLE? Clear comments on each module. Really comments are the best way for reusability, and maintainability.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

> Keeping a consistant documentation is the best place to start for any project. I hadn't made any documentation for what I needed to work on and that certainly would've helped in the process. 



3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

> Computer Scientists make things happen! Really they design, develop, deploy, and analyze software and solve software and hardware problems. That could be with with anything like databases or new software for the company.. so much!
